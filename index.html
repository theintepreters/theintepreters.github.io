	<p class = "home"> My story begin with my name "Tran". It is interesting that the word "tran" can combine with many other word conveying different meanings. It can mean a shameless gaze that we all used to have; it can mean the respect for our loved ones; or it can mean the pearl gem or the boba in the glass of boba tea.</p>
